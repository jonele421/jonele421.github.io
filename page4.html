    <i>
        <p>by William Shakespeare</p>
    </i>

    <p>Shall I compare thee to a summer's day? <br> Thou art more <i>lovely</i> and more <strong>
            temperate:</strong> <br> 
            Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May, 
            <br> And summer's lease hath all too short a <sup>date</sup>:
    </p>
    <p>
       Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines, <br>
       And often is his gold complexion <sub>dimm'ds</sub>, <br>
       And every fair from fair sometimes declines, <br>
       By chance, or nature's changing course untrimm'd: 
    </p>
    <p>
        But thy eternal summer shall not fade, <br>
        Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow'st, <br>
        Nor shall death brag thou wander'st in his shade, <br>
        When in eternal lines to time thou grow'st, <br>
        So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see, <br>
        So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
    </p>
